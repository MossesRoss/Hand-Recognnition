**Hand Gesture Volume Control**

This Python program uses computer vision and hand tracking to control the system volume. It tracks the vertical position of the index finger in the camera feed, adjusting the volume accordingly. Here's a brief overview and instructions on how to use the program:

### Dependencies:
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- pycaw

### Installation:
Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pycaw
```

### Usage:
1. Run the program.
2. A live video feed will appear.
3. Hold your hand in front of the camera.
4. Move your index finger up or down to control the system volume.
5. Press the space bar to exit the program.

### Note:
- Ensure that your system has a camera accessible by OpenCV.
- The program adjusts the system volume using pycaw, so it may not work on all systems.
